New Moon Cafe exists to offer fresh food, delicious coffee and a welcoming ambiance right in the heart of Burlington, Vermont.   

We opened in 2007 with a mission to serve the community through creative eating and authentic espresso.  This mission remains today as we offer locally-sourced food and specialty coffee to satisfy a wide range of palates.  

We specialize in made-to-order breakfast and lunch which includes open-faced toasts, entree salads and original sandwiches.  From dressings to rotating soups, our food is made from scratch each day using high quality ingredients which reflect Vermontâ€™s changing seasons. 

Our vibrant bakery supplies fresh baked muffins, scones and cookies each morning.  We also provide rotating specials for vegan and non-vegan customers alike.  

We brew Vivid Coffee in the form of delicious espresso drinks, dynamic single origin coffees and a unique New Moon house blend.  Additionally, our organic juices and fruit smoothies offer refreshing beverage options for any time of day.

As members of Vermont Fresh Network, we use fresh produce from local farms and cheese makers when seasons permit.

Our local suppliers include:
